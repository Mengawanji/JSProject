// Task

// We provide the implementation for a Rectangle class in the editor. Perform the following tasks:

// Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype.
// Create a Square class that satisfies the following:
// It is a subclass of Rectangle.
// It contains a constructor and no other methods.
// It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.


class Rectangle {
    constructor (w , h) {
        this.w = w;
        this.h = h;
    } 
}

Rectangle.prototype.area = function () {
    return this.w * this.h;
}

class Square {
    constructor (side) {
        super(side,side)
    }
}



// class Square extends Rectangle

// This means Square is a subclass of Rectangle.

// In other words, Square inherits everything from Rectangle (its properties and its prototype methods, like area).

// super calls the parent class‚Äôs constructor (Rectangle‚Äôs constructor).


// üëâ A good way to think about it:

// extends = ‚ÄúSquare is a type of Rectangle.‚Äù

// super() = ‚ÄúRun Rectangle‚Äôs setup code, but with square-specific values.
